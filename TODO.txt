Principles
- Concentrate on building up a MOCK IMPLEMENTATION - that is core
- Expect extensions is second (these _can_ export a standalone inspection library, but following vite/jest patterns is the central aim )
- The actual switching out with real fetch... that is best left to the testing frameworks... but again export an API to do this for peopel who prefer manual control


Corollaries:
- rename 'mock' to something else
- fallback to fetch... is this best left to jest too
- Look in the wild to see how people are using it
- rethink of inspecting API
- rethink of restore API

e.g vi.spyOn(globalThis, 'fetch').mockImplementation(fetchMock)
